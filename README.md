My try at creating an Open Badge based on materials from

* [New Issuers: Give Yourself a Badge](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki/New-Issuers:-Give-Yourself-a-Badge) (and the other [Wiki pages of Mozilla Open Badges Backpack on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki))
* [IMS Global Open Badges 2.0 Validator](https://openbadgesvalidator.imsglobal.org/)
* [OpenBadges Bakery](http://bakery.openbadges.org/) (an open badge baker)
* the [Mozilla Backpack Open Badges](https://backpack.openbadges.org/baker) builder/baker
* and a cast of many others ... thank you very much!
