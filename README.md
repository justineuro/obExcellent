My try at creating an Open Badge based on materials and tools from

* [Classic Badge Designer](https://openbadges.me/designer) provided by [<img height="20" align="top" style="margin: 0px -5px" width="200" src="https://www.myknowledgemap.com/img/logo/MKM.png"></img>](https://www.myknowledgemap.com/)
* [New Issuers: Give Yourself a Badge](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki/New-Issuers:-Give-Yourself-a-Badge) (and the other [Wiki pages of Mozilla Open Badges Backpack on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki))
* [IMS Global Open Badges 2.0 Validator](https://openbadgesvalidator.imsglobal.org/)
* [OpenBadges Bakery](http://bakery.openbadges.org/) (an open badge baker)
* the [Mozilla Backpack Open Badges](https://backpack.openbadges.org/baker) builder/baker
* and a cast of many others ... thank you very much!
